Red Compartida,PPI,Information and communications technology (ICT),ICT backbone,N/A,"Red Compartida (or Shared Network) will be the first fully wholesale mobile network deployed anywhere in the world. The Shared Network seeks to allow Mexicans to access coverage of telephony and internet services with higher quality and lower prices.

On July 9, 2014, the Mexican Government passed wide-ranging telecommunications reforms, designed to abolish long-distance phone charges, make it easier for customers to switch phone companies, and broaden access to free-to-air television stations. Under the new laws, the Mexican telecommunications regulator was required to establish a wholesale-only wireless network — a “carrier’s carrier” that will sell mobile-network capacity to all comers. In 2015, the regulator announced the “Red Compartida” initiative. On November 17, 2016, Mexico’s Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced that the ALTÁN Consortium won the international tender process for Red Compartida. The new wholesale network is expected to begin operations by March 31, 2018, covering 30% of the Mexican population. The network will grow to provide services nationwide using all-IP network and 4G-LTE technology on the 700 MHz spectrum band, reaching 92.2% of the Mexican population. 

The network concession is for a term of 20 years with an option to extend for another 20 years. After the concession period, the sponsor will transfer the ownership of the project to the Government. 

The Red Compartida network will be “wholesale only”. This means that the company which builds and operates the network will not be involved in providing mobile service to consumers. Instead, the operator will provide access to the network to mobile operators, who will in turn use the network capacity to provide a consumer mobile product. Access to the network for these operators will be sold to the highest bidder in regular auctions.  The cost of building a mobile network is prohibitive and requires billions of dollars in capital outlay. By providing the infrastructure through a wholesale only network, the cost of offering a new consumer service to Mexican customers will be significantly reduced.

Altán, made up of various investment funds such as the China-Mexico bi - national fund or International Finance Corporation, administered by the World Bank, as well as some companies such as Axtel and Megacable among others.

Atizapan - Atlacomulco Highway,PPI,Transport,Roads,N/A,"The project scope involves the  financing, construction, operation and maintenance of a toll  road between Atizapan and Atlacomulco with a total length of 74 kilometers.

Concesionaria AT-AT, S.A. de C.V. is the concessionaire leading the project on behalf of the sponsor OHL Mexico, part of the Spanish company OHL. OHL Mexico won the contract in March 2014 following a public tender offer based on lowest cost of construction and operation criteria. 

Although the road concession was awarded in 2014, and expected to be completed in 2016, obtaining the right of way was complicated and adjustments had to be made to the line. The delay in the work caused an impact on costs. OHL México won the contract with a construction cost of 5,860 million pesos, and but now the Ministry of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reports a total investment of 9,500 million pesos (approximately $520 million).

A syndicate of three lenders is providing the debt: Banobras, Santander and Inbursa. Each of the lenders provided $53.17 million in the form of term loan and Banobras and Inbursa provided additional funds ($79.75 million each) in VAT facility. OHL expects to contribute about 40% of the project cost with its own capital and it had already put most of the equity capital (approximately Ps3 billion) in the project's trust. OHL will replicate the same financing structure as achieved for its Conmex toll road for all of its Mexican highway concessions: tapping the bank market for construction and then refinancing in the capital markets ""to accommodate debt to match the real performance of the road"".

Upon completion the road aims to improve the connectivity of the Metropolitan Area in the Valley of Mexico with the north and west of the country.
